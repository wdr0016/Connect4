	Simulation files - The below files are simulations represneting the different matchups invloved in this project. These will run 2000 games of each of the methods in the title with them taking turns as to who goes first. They can be run by simply executing them with the "python filename.py" command.

		heroVsBaseline.py  
		heroVsHero.py  
		heroVsRando.py  
		minimaxVsMinimax.py  
		miniVsHero.py

		randomVsRandom.py  
	Supporting files - The below files support the simulations either by creating methods to execute the next turn, or supporting the methods that execute the next turn. These files are not meant to be run.
